# 1. What is Virtualization?

## 1.1 Concept
In computing, virtualization refers to the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, including virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources.

Virtualization is a resource management technology that abstracts and transforms various physical resources of a computer, such as servers, networks, memory, and storage. Virtualization breaks the inseparable barriers between physical structures, allowing users to use these resources in a better way than the original configuration. The new virtual part of these resources is not restricted by the way existing resources are erected,and geographical or physical configuration. Generally referred to as virtualized resources include computer power and data storage.

In the actual production environment, virtualization technology is mainly used to solve the reorganization and reuse of high-performance physical hardware overcapacity and old hardware undercapacity so as to maximize the use of physical hardware. So the purpose of virtualization is to make full use of resources.
