Use Docker to deploy a web site supporting HTTPS with Tomcat as the server. The principle is similar to that of deploying on a common server. You only need to put the software package developed by yourself in the Tomcat project directory. The difference is that the Tomcat server must be started in the container, and the corresponding project source code must also be imported into the container.
