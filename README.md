# Intern_2020
A daily working log for my internship at VMware in 2020.

## Working Goal
- Summarize docker users' workflow/best practices and try to use vctl to accomplish them
  & Find the priority to add vctl commands
- Use Golang to program vctl commands
- Try to add registry mirrors through vctl
    [(Registry-Mirrors)](https://github.com/Noah-Du/Intern_2020/blob/master/Registry-Mirrors.md)
